# Logging
ZF2 Boilerplate provides a `logger` service by default in the `Core` module. This service can be used to easily write log messages about various domain specific events, errors or exceptions.

Default logging target for both HTTP and application logs is `data/logs` and all files under the this directory excluded in [.gitignore](/.gitignore).

## Application logs
Logger service instance will be lazily-created by [LoggerAbstractServiceFactory](https://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/zend.mvc.services.html#zend-log-loggerabstractservicefactory) when you try to fetch `logger` service from the **ServiceLocator** first time and that factory uses the configuration signature which can be found under the `log` top key in `Core/config/module.config.php`.

By default, `logger` service uses a **stream writer** to write log messages under the `data/logs` folder with a `file per day` filename convention like below:

```
data
├── logs
│   ├── application.2015.07.19.log
│   └── application.2015.07.20.log
└── testresults
```

Feel free to change logging configuration, stream target or adding a custom processor(s) for your requirements.

> NOTICE - Since stream target configured as `'stream' => 'data/logs/application.'.date('Y.m.d').'.log'` in `module.config.php`; on a production environment after merging the configuration files, the result will be cached and this behaviour may lead a problem which is writing messages into the wrong Y-m-d.log files. To aviod this side-effect, you may want to clear the configuration cache every midnight or rolling your own solution. (Please create a PR if you found better approach!)

### Usage
Simply get the `logger` service instance from ServiceLocator in your Controllers or Services and use it like below:

```
$user = $this->userService->createUser($data);
if($user instanceof User) {
   $logger = $this->getServiceLocator()->get('logger');
   $logger->info('A new user has been created');
}
```

There are eight different [log priorities](http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/modules/zend.log.overview.html#using-built-in-priorities) exists in Zend Framework 2:

```
EMERG   = 0;  // Emergency: system is unusable
ALERT   = 1;  // Alert: action must be taken immediately
CRIT    = 2;  // Critical: critical conditions
ERR     = 3;  // Error: error conditions
WARN    = 4;  // Warning: warning conditions
NOTICE  = 5;  // Notice: normal but significant condition
INFO    = 6;  // Informational: informational messages
DEBUG   = 7;  // Debug: debug messages
```

and you can designate the message priorities for specific use-cases like below:

```
$logger->warn('Foo warning - Disk is full');
$logger->info('Staff '.$user->getName().' logged in');
$logger->crit('An exception thrown when writing the result to the database');
$logger->emerg('Emergency message here');
$logger->debug('Baz bat');
```



## HTTP Server Logs
There are also six empty HTTP server log files exists in the `data/logs` folder, we created these empty files as example placeholders (for portability) and all of them ignored in `.gitignore`.

Anytime you can change the http server log targets by your requirements. (Especially on production environment)

```
data
├── logs
│   ├── admin.access.log
│   ├── admin.error.log
│   ├── api.access.log
│   ├── api.error.log
│   ├── www.access.log
│   └── www.error.log
└── testresults
```
