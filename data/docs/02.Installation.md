# Installation
This is documentation for installation.

Firstly, install your PHP libraries with following command.

```
$ php composer.phar install
```

Lots of library will download and install. 
Secondly, install [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) to front-end package management. 
And install [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate compilation and minification of your css files.
Following command require Nodejs. You should install node to your system before execute the following line.

```
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower install
$ npm install
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ grunt dev
```

That's all. You are ready. 

## Database
 - Create a database named `boilerplate`.
 - Create a local copy of doctrine.local.php.dist file using the commands below:

```
cd /path/to/boilerplate
cp config/autoload/doctrine.local.{php.dist,php}
```

 - And replace the `@dbuser`, `@dbpass` and `@dbname` values with yours.

## HTTP Server

Create a new virtual server on nginx.

Nginx configurations for admin interface : 

```
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  admin.boilerplate.local;

    root      /path-your-project/public;

    location / {
        index           index.html index.php index.htm;
        autoindex       on;
        try_files       $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
        proxy_intercept_errors on;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_index               index.php;
        include                     fastcgi.conf;
        fastcgi_intercept_errors    on;
        fastcgi_pass                127.0.0.1:9001;
        proxy_intercept_errors on;


        try_files                   $uri =404;
        fastcgi_split_path_info     ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /path-your-project/public/index.php$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT /path-your-project/public;
        fastcgi_param APPLICATION_ENV staging;
    }
}
```

Currently domain is `admin.boilerplate.local`. You can use different name but you should change your application.config.php file.
