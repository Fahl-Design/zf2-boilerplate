# ZF2 Boilerplate
ZF2 Boilerplate is an unofficial & enhanced version of the original [skeleton application](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication), serve as a simple starting point to begin building your application based on [Zend Framework 2](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2) while utilizing modern & must-have third party tools and libraries like [Bower](http://bower.io/), [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Imagine](https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine), [DoctrineORMModule](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineORMModule), [Phpunit](https://phpunit.de/) etc..

This project also aims to reduce repeated steps to start a new project based on ZF2 & Doctrine 2 while applying and following common best-practices for applications which care about scaling.
